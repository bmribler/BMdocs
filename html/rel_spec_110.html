Migrating from HDF5 1.8 to HDF5 1.10</h1>
<p>The HDF Group will drop support for HDF5 1.8.* releases in the summer of 2020. We strongly recommend that our users start migrating their applications as soon as possible and we ask that any problems that are encountered be reported to The HDF Group. Problems can be reported by sending email to <a href="#" onclick="location.href='mai'+'lto:'+'hel'+'p@'+'hdf'+'gr'+'oup'+'.o'+'rg'; return false;">help@<span style="display: none;">.nosp@m.</span>hdfg<span style="display: none;">.nosp@m.</span>roup.<span style="display: none;">.nosp@m.</span>org</a>, submitting a request to the The HDF Group&rsquo;s Help Desk at <a href="#" onclick="location.href='mai'+'lto:'+'hel'+'p@'+'hdf'+'gr'+'oup'+'.o'+'rg'; return false;">HDF Help Desk</a>, or posting to the <a href="https://forum.hdfgroup.org/">HDF Forum</a>.</p>
<p>Please follow these steps for moving your HDF5 application to HDF5 1.10: </p><ol>
<li>
Make sure the latest (1.1.0.5+) version of HDF5 1.10 is installed on your system. You can download the HDF5 1.10 release source code or pre-built binaries from The HDF Group, <a href="https://support.hdfgroup.org/archive/support/ftp/HDF5/releases/index.html">Archive Releases</a> and follow the included installation instructions. </li>
<li>
If on Unix, you can recompile and relink your application with HDF5 1.10, by using the h5cc script with any compiler flags needed for your application. The h5cc script can be found under the bin sub-directory of the HDF5 1.10 installation point. In cases where your software package has a more complex build system and dependencies, just make sure you point to the new HDF5 1.10.* library when rebuilding your software. </li>
<li>
If your application or software package has any regression test suite, run it and make sure that all tests pass. </li>
<li>
Please contact us if you find any problems. </li>
</ol>
<p>If you have concerns about the files created by the rebuilt application (or software package), you may wish to consider several verification steps to assure that the files can be read by applications built with HDF5 1.8 releases. </p><ol>
<li>
Use the tools you regularly work with to open, browse, and modify the files created by the rebuilt application (for example, HDFView, MATLAB, IDL, etc.). </li>
<li>
If you have an HDF5 1.8.* installation on your system, use <a class="el" href="_h5_t_o_o_l__d_p__u_g.html#sec_cltools_h5dump">h5dump</a> from that installation to read files created by the rebuilt application. If you encounter any errors, please rerun <a class="el" href="_h5_t_o_o_l__d_p__u_g.html#sec_cltools_h5dump">h5dump</a> with the <code>&ndash;enable-error-stack</code> flag and report the issue. </li>
<li>
If you have files created by your application that were built with HDF5 1.8, use <a class="el" href="_h5_t_o_o_l__d_f__u_g.html#sec_cltools_h5diff">h5diff</a> from the HDF5 1.8 installation to compare with the files created by the rebuilt application. </li>
</ol>

<h2><a class="anchor" id="subsec_rel_spec_110_migrate_faq"></a>
FAQ</h2>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="subsubsec_rel_spec_110_migrate_faq_1"></a>
What is the difference between the HDF5 1.8 and HDF5 1.10 releases ?</h3>
<p>Many new features (e.g., SWMR, VDS, paged allocation, etc.) that required extensions to the HDF5 file format were added to HDF5 1.10.0. For more information please see the Release Specific Information pages.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="subsubsec_rel_spec_110_migrate_faq_2"></a>
Why one should (or should not) move an application to HDF5 1.10 ?</h3>
<p>HDF5 1.8 will not be supported after the May 2020 release, i.e., there will be no more public releases of HDF5 1.8 with security patches, bug fixes, performance improvements and support for OSs and compilers.</p>
<p>In addition, applications originally written for use with HDF5 Release 1.8.x can be linked against the HDF5 Release 1.10.x library, thus taking advantage of performance improvements in 1.10. Users are encouraged to move to the latest releases of HDF5 1.10 or to HDF5 1.12.0 (coming out in the summer of 2019) if they want to stay with the current HDF5 upgrades.</p>
<p>If you are not planning to upgrade your system environment, and a version of HDF5 1.8.* works for you, then there is no reason to upgrade to the latest HDF5. However, if you regularly update your software to use the latest HDF5 1.8 maintenance release, then you need to plan a transition to HDF5 1.10 after the HDF5 1.8 May 2020 release.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="subsubsec_rel_spec_110_migrate_faq_3"></a>
Why do I need to rebuild my application with HDF5 1.10?</h3>
<p>The HDF5 1.10.* binaries are not ABI compatible with the HDF5 1.8.* binaries due to changes in the public header files and APIs. One has to rebuild an application with the HDF5 1.10.* library. The HDF Group tries hard to maintain ABI compatibility for minor maintenance releases, for example when moving from 1.8.21 to 1.8.22, or 1.10.5 to 1.10.6, but this is not the case when migrating from one major release to another, for example, from 1.8.21 to 1.10.5. If you want to learn more about HDF5 versioning please see HDF5 Library Release Version Numbers.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="subsubsec_rel_spec_110_migrate_faq_4"></a>
Can I migrate my application if I still use the HDF5 1.6 APIs?</h3>
<p>Yes, use the -DH5_USE_16_API compiler flag. For more information see the <a class="el" href="api-compat-macros.html">API Compatibility Macros</a>.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="subsubsec_rel_spec_110_migrate_faq_5"></a>
Will my old software read files created by an application rebuilt with HDF5 1.10?</h3>
<p>If the application built on HDF5 Release 1.10 avoids use of the new features and does not request use of the latest format, applications built on HDF5 Release 1.8.x will be able to read files the first application created.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="subsubsec_rel_spec_110_migrate_faq_6"></a>
Can I use the HDF5 tools I use now to read files created with the new HDF5 1.10 features?</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, no. However, we provide a few tools that will help you to “downgrade” the file, so it can be opened and used with tools and applications built with the 1.8 versions of HDF5.</p>
<p>If your application uses SWMR, then the <a class="el" href="_h5_t_o_o_l__f_c__u_g.html#sec_cltools_h5format_convert">h5format_convert</a> tool can be used to “downgrade” the file to the HDF5 1.8 compatible file format without rewriting raw data.</p>
<p>The <a class="el" href="_h5_t_o_o_l__r_p__u_g.html#sec_cltools_h5repack">h5repack</a> tool with –l flag can be used to repack VDS source datasets into the HDF5 file using contiguous, chunked or compact storage. The tool can also be used to rewrite the file using the HDF5 1.8 format by specifying the <code>&ndash;high=H5F_LIBVER_V18</code> flag.</p>

New Features in HDF5 Release 1.10</h1>
<p>HDF5 1.10 introduces several new features in the HDF5 library. These new features were added in the first three releases of HDF5-1.10. For a brief description of each new feature see: </p><ul>
<li><a class="el" href="rel_spec_110.html#subsec_rel_spec_110_feat_new_8">New Features Introduced in HDF5 1.10.8</a> </li>

<li><a class="el" href="rel_spec_110.html#subsec_rel_spec_110_feat_new_0">New Features Introduced in HDF5 1.10.0</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This release includes changes in the HDF5 storage format. For detailed information on the changes, see: Changes to the File Format Specification</p>
<p>/note PLEASE NOTE that HDF5-1.8 cannot read files created with the new features described below that are marked with *.</p>
<p>These changes come into play when one or more of the new features is used or when an application calls for use of the latest storage format (<a class="el" href="group___f_a_p_l.html#gacbe1724e7f70cd17ed687417a1d2a910" title="Controls the range of library release versions used when creating objects in a file.">H5Pset_libver_bounds</a>). See the <a href="https://support.hdfgroup.org/releases/hdf5/documentation/rfc/RFC-bounds.pdf">Setting Bounds for Object Creation in HDF5 1.10.0</a> for more details.</p>
<p>Due to the requirements of some of the new features, the format of a 1.10.x HDF5 file is likely to be different from that of a 1.8.x HDF5 file. This means that tools and applications built to read 1.10.x files will be able to read a 1.8.x file, but tools built to read 1.8.x files may not be able to read a 1.10.x file.</p>
<p>If an application built on HDF5 Release 1.10 avoids use of the new features and does not request use of the latest format, applications built on HDF5 Release 1.8.x will be able to read files the first application created. In addition, applications originally written for use with HDF5 Release 1.8.x can be linked against a suitably configured HDF5 Release 1.10.x library, thus taking advantage of performance improvements in 1.10.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="subsec_rel_spec_110_feat_new_8"></a>
New Features Introduced in HDF5 1.10.8</h2>
<p>The following important new features and changes were introduced in HDF5-1.10.8. For complete details see the Release Notes and the <a class="el" href="rel_spec_110_change.html#sec_rel_spec_110_change">Software Changes from Release to Release in HDF5 1.10</a> page.</p>

New Features Introduced in HDF5 1.10.5</h2>
<p>The following important new features were added in HDF5-1.10.5. Please see the release announcement and <a class="el" href="rel_spec_110_change.html#sec_rel_spec_110_change">Software Changes from Release to Release in HDF5 1.10</a> page for more details regarding these features:</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="subsubsec_rel_spec_110_feat_new_5_ohdr"></a>
Minimized Dataset Object Headers</h3>
<p>The ability to minimize dataset object headers was added to reduce the file bloat caused by extra space in the dataset object header. The file bloat can occur when creating many, very small datasets. See the Release Notes and <a href="https://support.hdfgroup.org/releases/hdf5/documentation/rfc/RFC_Min_Obj_Headers_181231.pdf">Dataset Object Header Size</a> for more details regarding this issue.</p>
<p>The following APIs were introduced to support this feature: </p><ul>
<li><a class="el" href="group___h5_f.html#gacbf3ba8b36750c42b49740567a9732c4" title="Retrieves the setting for whether or not a file will create minimized dataset object headers.">H5Fget_dset_no_attrs_hint</a> - Retrieves the setting for determining whether the specified file does or does not create minimized dataset object headers </li>

</ul>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="subsubsec_rel_spec_110_feat_new_5_parchg"></a>
Parallel Library Change (RFC)</h3>
<p>A change was added to the default behavior in parallel when reading the same dataset in its entirety (i.e. H5S_ALL dataset selection) which is being read by all the processes collectively. The dataset must be contiguous, less than 2GB, and of an atomic datatype. The new behavior in the HDF5 library uses an MPI_Bcast to pass the data read from the disk by the root process to the remaining processes in the MPI communicator associated with the HDF5 file.</p>
<p>A CFD application was used to benchmark CGNS with: </p><ul>
<li>compact storage </li>
<li>read-proc0-and-bcast</li>
</ul>
<p>These results were reported by Greg Sjaardema from Sandia National Laboratories.</p>
<p>(image missing)</p>
<p>Series 1 is the read-proc0-and-bcast solution Series 2 is a single MPI_Bcast Series 3 uses multiple MPI_Bcast totaling 2 MiB total data 64 bytes at a time (IIRC) Series 4 is unmodified CGNS develop Compact is using compact storage Compact 192 is also using compact storage Compact 384 is also using compact storage The last 3 "compact" curves are just three different batch jobs on 192, 384, and 552 nodes (with 36 core/node). The Series 2 and 3 curves are not related to the CGNS benchmark, but give a qualitative indication on the scaling behavior of MPI_Bcast. Both read-proc0-and-bcast and compact storage follow MPI_Bcast's trend, which makes sense since both methods rely on MPI_Bcast.

<h2><a class="anchor" id="subsec_rel_spec_110_feat_new_1"></a>
New Features Introduced in HDF5 1.10.1</h2>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="subsubsec_rel_spec_110_feat_new_1_cache"></a>
Metadata Cache Image -&gt; Fine-tuning the Metadata Cache *</h3>
<p>HDF5 metadata is typically small, and scattered throughout the HDF5 file. This can affect performance, particularly on large HPC systems. The Metadata Cache Image feature can improve performance by writing the metadata cache in a single block on file close, and then populating the cache with the contents of this block on file open, thus avoiding the many small I/O operations that would otherwise be required on file open and close.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://support.hdfgroup.org/releases/hdf5/documentation/rfc/cache_image_RFC_150929-QAK.docx.pdf">Metadata Cache Image</a> for more details.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="subsubsec_rel_spec_110_feat_new_1_evict"></a>
Metadata Cache Evict on Close -&gt; Fine-tuning the Metadata Cache</h3>
<p>The HDF5 library's metadata cache is fairly conservative about holding on to HDF5 object metadata (object headers, chunk index structures, etc.), which can cause the cache size to grow, resulting in memory pressure on an application or system. The "evict on close" property will cause all metadata for an object to be evicted from the cache as long as metadata is not referenced from any other open object.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="subsubsec_rel_spec_110_feat_new_1_pagg"></a>
Paged Aggregation -&gt; File Space Management *</h3>
<p>The current HDF5 file space allocation accumulates small pieces of metadata and raw data in aggregator blocks which are not page aligned and vary widely in sizes. The paged aggregation feature was implemented to provide efficient paged access of these small pieces of metadata and raw data.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://support.hdfgroup.org/releases/hdf5/documentation/rfc/paged_aggregation.pdf">HDF5 File Space Management: Paged Aggregation</a> and <a href="https://support.hdfgroup.org/releases/hdf5/documentation/rfc/FileSpaceManagement.pdf">HDF5 File Space Management</a> for more details.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="subsubsec_rel_spec_110_feat_new_1_pbuf"></a>
Page Buffering</h3>
<p>Small and random I/O accesses on parallel file systems result in poor performance for applications. Page buffering in conjunction with paged aggregation can improve performance by giving an application control of minimizing HDF5 I/O requests to a specific granularity and alignment.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://support.hdfgroup.org/releases/hdf5/documentation/rfc/RFC-Page_Buffering.pdf">Page Buffering</a> for more details.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="subsec_rel_spec_110_feat_new_0"></a>
New Features Introduced in HDF5 1.10.0</h2>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="subsubsec_rel_spec_110_feat_new_0_smr"></a>
SWMR *</h3>
<p>Data acquisition and computer modeling systems often need to analyze and visualize data while it is being written. It is not unusual, for example, for an application to produce results in the middle of a run that suggest some basic parameters be changed, sensors be adjusted, or the run be scrapped entirely.</p>
<p>To enable users to check on such systems, we have been developing a concurrent read/write file access pattern we call SWMR (pronounced swimmer). SWMR is short for single-writer/multiple-reader. SWMR functionality allows a writer process to add data to a file while multiple reader processes read from the file.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="subsubsec_rel_spec_110_feat_new_0_tune"></a>
Fine-tuning the Metadata Cache</h3>
<p>The orderly operation of the metadata cache is crucial to SWMR functioning. A number of APIs have been developed to handle the requests from writer and reader processes and to give applications the control of the metadata cache they might need. However, the metadata cache APIs can be used when SWMR is not being used; so, these functions are described separately.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="subsubsec_rel_spec_110_feat_new_0_coll"></a>
Collective Metadata I/O</h3>
<p>Calls for HDF5 metadata can result in many small reads and writes. On metadata reads, collective metadata I/O can improve performance by allowing the library to perform optimizations when reading the metadata, by having one rank read the data and broadcasting it to all other ranks.</p>
<p>Collective metadata I/O improves metadata write performance through the construction of an MPI derived datatype that is then written collectively in a single call.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="subsubsec_rel_spec_110_feat_new_0_fspace"></a>
File Space Management *</h3>
<p>Usage patterns when working with an HDF5 file sometimes result in wasted space within the file This can also impair access times when working with the resulting files. The new file space management feature provides strategies for managing space in a file to improve performance in both of these arenas.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="subsubsec_rel_spec_110_feat_new_0_vds"></a>
Virtual Datasets (VDS) *</h3>
<p>With a growing amount of data in HDF5, the need has emerged to access data stored across multiple HDF5 files using standard HDF5 objects, such as groups and datasets, without rewriting or rearranging the data. The new virtual dataset (VDS) feature enables an application to draw on multiple datasets and files to create virtual datasets without moving or rewriting any data.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="subsubsec_rel_spec_110_feat_new_0_edge"></a>
Partial Edge Chunk Options *</h3>
<p>New options for the storage and filtering of partial edge chunks in a dataset provide a tool for tuning I/O speed and file size in cases where the dataset size may not be a multiple of the chunk size.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="subsubsec_rel_spec_110_feat_new_0_add"></a>
Additional New APIs</h3>
<p>In addition to the features described above, several additional new functions, a new struct, and new macros have been introduced or newly versioned in this release.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="subsubsec_rel_spec_110_feat_new_0_form"></a>
Changes to the File Format Specification</h3>
<p>The file format of the HDF5 library has been changed to support the new features in HDF5-1.10.</p>
<p>See the <a class="el" href="_f_m_t11.html">HDF5 File Format Specification Version 1.1</a> for complete details on the changes. This specification describes how the bytes in an HDF5 file are organized on the storage media where the file is kept. In other words, when a file is written to disk, the file will be written according to the information described in this file. The following sections have been added or changed: </p><ul>
<li>Another version of the superblock was added. </li>
<li>Additional B-tree types were added to the version 2 B-trees. </li>
<li>The global heap block for virtual datasets was added. </li>
<li>The Data Layout Message was changed: the name was changed, and version 4 of the data layout message was added for the virtual type. </li>
<li>Additional types of indexes were added for dataset chunks.</li>
</ul>
<p>HDF5-1.8 cannot read files created with the new features described on this page that are marked with *.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="subsec_rel_spec_110_feat_add"></a>
